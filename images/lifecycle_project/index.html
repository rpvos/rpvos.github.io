        This is a project done with 3 other students and a teacher.
        It is about helping other students write code and get feedback on that code in a whole new framework.
        In this project we will be emulating hardware so it can be interchanged with real hardware.
        We will add different languages support.
        It will be an envirement where students can learn and teachers, when granted acces, can view the progress and quality.

        In this project we use the following programs:
        - Docker
        - Gitlab
        - ClickUp
        - IAAC

        This project is developed so other institutions can use it to set up projects for class years.
