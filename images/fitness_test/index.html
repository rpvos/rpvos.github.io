		Fitness test is an windows application made in c#.
		This application is made to calculate the fitness of clients for a doctor.
		It was designed so a doctor can communicate with clients and see their progress.
		This is all done through a BLE connection with a bike and heartrate sensor.
		This project was build with an client server architecture.
		The client can use VR glasses to visualize the test in a virtual world.
		The VR processing was done using an extern server to whom JSON packets were send to build the world and handle the camera position and bike.

		In this project was C# .net core and wpf used.
		The project was made with 5 other students.
