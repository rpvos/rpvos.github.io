        This project contains the game set.
        Set is a game where you have to make sets of three cards.
        All the cards can have 4 different properties.
        - amount
        - color
        - filling
        - shape
        
        To have a correct set you must have all different properties, 3 equal and 1 different or 2 equal and 2 different.


        This project was done with Stijn Lemm.
