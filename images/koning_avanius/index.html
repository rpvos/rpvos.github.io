        Koning Avanius (King Avanius) is a fictonal figure we designed for this project.
        This application was created with the soul purpous to enrich the experience in a amusement park.
        For this amusement park we picked the Esteling (fictional Efteling). 
        
        The story goes as follows: There once was a king that lost his password to the treasury and you will have to help him.
        This can be done by awnsering questions. 
        When you have completed a treasure trail, you can deceifer the password.

        This project was done with five other students.
		The code is written in Java.
